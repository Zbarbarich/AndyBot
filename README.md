## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

For **development mode** (see below) you use the hosted database via an SSH tunnel; no local PostgreSQL is required. For **local database** development you would need PostgreSQL (v12+) and would run migrations yourself.

## Development mode (recommended: local app + hosted DB via SSH tunnel)

The application is cloud-hosted on Oracle Cloud, with PostgreSQL running there. This setup lets you run the frontend and backend locally while connecting to the **same PostgreSQL database** used by the hosted app (via an SSH tunnel). No Docker and no local Postgres needed. All local env files are gitignored; production and CI/CD are unchanged.

### One-time setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. **Create local env files from examples** (do not commit these; they are in `.gitignore`):
   ```bash
   cp backend/auth-service/.env.example backend/auth-service/.env
   cp backend/api-gateway/.env.example backend/api-gateway/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```

3. **Edit `backend/auth-service/.env`** for the tunnel setup. The app expects **`DB_*`** variable names (not `POSTGRES_*`). Use exactly:
   - **DB_HOST=localhost** — required when using the SSH tunnel (tunnel forwards a local port to the server’s Postgres).
   - **DB_PORT=5432** — or **5433** (or another free port) if local PostgreSQL already uses 5432; the SSH `-L` local port must match `DB_PORT` (e.g. `-L 5433:127.0.0.1:5432`).
   - **DB_NAME=the_nineteenth_chamber** — must match the hosted app’s database name (lowercase, underscores).
   - **DB_USER** and **DB_PASSWORD** — same as on the server (e.g. from the deploy env or from `docker exec deploy-postgres-1 env | grep POSTGRES_` on the server; the role name is often the value of `POSTGRES_USER`).
   - **DB_SSL=false** — the Postgres container on the server does not use SSL; the tunnel is already encrypted.

   Example (replace with your real credentials):
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=the_nineteenth_chamber
   DB_USER=your_actual_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   DB_SSL=false
   ```

4. **Propagate auth-service env to all DB-using services** (customer, ticket, order, invoice, pdf) and set their ports:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   chmod +x scripts/setup-env.sh
   ./scripts/setup-env.sh
   ```

5. **Edit `backend/api-gateway/.env`** — ensure `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173` so the browser can call the API when the frontend runs on port 5173.

6. **Edit `frontend/.env`** — ensure `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3000` so the dev server talks to your local API gateway.

### Port 5432 on your machine

If you have **local PostgreSQL** installed and it is using port 5432, either stop it while using the tunnel or the tunnel will fail with “Address already in use.” You do not need local Postgres for this development setup.

### Run each time you develop

1. **Open the SSH tunnel** (leave this terminal open):
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your/key -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP
   ```
   Replace with your key path and server IP. This forwards your local port 5432 to the Postgres container on the server.

2. **Start the backend** (from repo root or `backend/`):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or from repo root: `npm start` (starts backend only; start frontend separately).

3. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the app:** http://localhost:5173 — you’ll be using the same data as the hosted app (same DB via tunnel).

### Summary

| Item | Development mode | Production (hosted) |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| Env source | Per-service `.env` (gitignored), from `.env.example` | `deploy/.env` + Docker Compose |
| DB connection | SSH tunnel: localhost:5432 → server Postgres | Containers → `postgres:5432` |
| Start | Tunnel + `npm run dev` (backend + frontend) | `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file deploy/.env up` |

### Preparing for commit

- **Do not commit** `.env` or `deploy/.env` — they are listed in `.gitignore`. They contain secrets and local/remote DB settings.
- **Safe to commit:** code changes, `.env.example` files, README, `setup-env.sh`, `backend/shared/schema/*.sql`, and migration runner scripts under `backend/scripts/` (no secrets). Run `git status` before committing to confirm no `.env` files are staged.
- **Deploy:** After pulling, apply new SQL migrations on each environment before relying on new columns (e.g. **020** / **021** — see Database Schema below). CI/CD should run migrations or document a manual `psql` / `node ../scripts/run-migration-0xx.js` step against production.

## Development (other)

**Backend only (from repo root):**
```bash
npm start
```

**Backend only (from backend/):**
```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
```

Hot reloading: frontend (Vite HMR), backend (Nodemon).

## Services (ports)

When running locally:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- API Gateway: http://localhost:3000
- Auth Service: http://localhost:3001
- Customer Service: http://localhost:3003
- Ticket Service: http://localhost:3004
- Order Service: http://localhost:3005
- Invoice Service: http://localhost:3006
- PDF Service: http://localhost:3007

## API Endpoints

**Auth (no JWT required for login/register):**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/users` - Create user (public for first user)
- `GET /api/auth/users` - Get all users (admin)
- `PUT /api/auth/users/:id` - Update user (admin)
- `DELETE /api/auth/users/:id` - Delete user (admin)

**App (JWT required; gateway proxies to the appropriate service):**
- Customers, tickets, orders, quotes, invoices, items, purchase orders, and PDFs are exposed under `/api/app/*`. The gateway proxies requests to customer-service, ticket-service, order-service, invoice-service, or pdf-service by path.
- **Purchase orders:** `GET /api/app/purchase-orders`, `GET /api/app/purchase-orders/:id`, `PATCH /api/app/purchase-orders/:id/close`, `PATCH /api/app/purchase-orders/:id/cancel` (open POs only), `GET /api/app/purchase-orders/:id/pdf` (proxied to order-service and pdf-service).
- **Global search:** `GET /api/app/search?q=<term>` returns aggregated results from customers, tickets, orders, invoices, items, and purchase orders: `{ customers, tickets, orders, invoices, items, purchase_orders }`.
- **Customer payment history:** `GET /api/app/customers/:id/payment-history` returns all invoice payments and order deposits for that customer. Payments can be reversed via `DELETE /api/app/invoices/:id/payments/:paymentId` (invoice payments) or `DELETE /api/app/orders/:orderId/deposits/:depositId` (unapplied deposits only).

## Database Schema

The same PostgreSQL database is used by auth-service and all app services. Schema is in `backend/shared/schema/`; run migrations in numeric order. See `backend/shared/schema/README.md` for table/FK reference, timezone, and timestamp discipline.

**Migrations 020–021 (purchase order lines & ticket attachments):**

- **020** (`020_purchase_order_line_notes_received.sql`) — adds `purchase_order_lines.ordered_via_notes` and `received_at` (notes/URL when ordering Online or Other; mark received).
- **021** (`021_ticket_attachments_extend.sql`) — adds `ticket_images.mime_type` and `original_filename`, widens attachment position limit to 1–10.

Run on each environment after deploy using the SQL files or `backend/scripts/run-migration-020.js` / `run-migration-021.js` (from `order-service` / `ticket-service` with `NODE_PATH=./node_modules`, same as other migration scripts). Without these, PO detail and ticket attachment APIs can return 500 (missing columns).

**API gateway:** JSON body size limit is increased (e.g. 10MB) so ticket attachment uploads (base64 in JSON) are accepted; ticket-service already uses a matching limit.

**Users table (auth):**
- `userID` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `userName` (VARCHAR(50))
- `password` (VARCHAR(255)) - bcrypt hashed
- `email` (VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL)
- `role` (VARCHAR(10)) - 'admin' or 'tech'

App services use additional tables for customers, tickets, orders, quotes, invoices, items, purchase orders, order deposits, and related data. All DB connections set `timezone = 'America/New_York'`; the app displays dates as mm/dd/yyyy in Eastern. Notable schema: `order_deposits`, `invoice_payments`, `purchase_orders` / `purchase_order_lines`; quantity_billed and customer contact; migrations 014-019 (contact, quantity_billed, decimals, deposits, data clear, redundant index drop). See the SQL files and `backend/shared/schema/README.md`.

## Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application with protected routes. Login persists the JWT and user in AuthContext (and localStorage). The authenticated layout (AppLayout) includes:

- A collapsible sidebar with A.N.D.Y. branding (Bot icon + “A.N.D.Y.” and tagline when expanded; Bot icon only when collapsed), then nav links: The Yard, Customers, Tickets, Begin Order, Invoices, Purchasing, Items, Admin. Sidebar expand/collapse chevron is borderless and transparent.
- A header with global search (pill-shaped, debounced input; grouped results: customers, tickets, orders/quotes, invoices, purchase orders, items) and a profile dropdown (logged-in user, logout)

**Routes:** `/` (The Yard), `/customers`, `/customers/new`, `/customers/:id`, `/customers/:id/payment-history`, `/tickets`, `/tickets/new`, `/tickets/:id`, `/tickets/:id/edit`, `/orders`, `/orders/:id`, `/orders/:id/billing`, `/invoices`, `/invoices/bill-order`, `/invoices/:id`, `/purchasing`, `/purchasing/:id`, `/items`, `/items/new`, `/items/:id`, `/items/:id/edit`, `/admin`, `/admin/users/new`. Quotes redirect to orders.

**Pages:** Landing, Customers, Customer form/detail, Customer payment history (with reverse payment), Tickets, Ticket form/detail/edit, Orders (and quotes), Order/Quote detail (deposits, POs), Billing (per order), Invoices, Bill order, Invoice detail, Purchasing, Purchase order detail, Items (list/form/detail/edit), Admin (users, create user).

**Orders & quotes:** Line quantity and unit price use text inputs while typing and commit on blur (so you can clear the field and type a new value). On an existing **order**, the default view is “Current order (remaining to bill)” — quantity shows **remaining** only while **read-only**; click **Edit** in the header to change full line quantities and prices. **Save** / **Cancel** live in the header next to the back control (not duplicated in the order summary). Saving validates that no line’s quantity is below what is already invoiced.

**Order detail & purchase orders (same line on multiple POs):** For **orders** only, `GET` and `PUT /api/app/orders/:id` attach **`on_purchase_orders`** to each line (non-cancelled POs that reference that line: id, `po_number`, status). The order screen shows a single-line note under the description, **On purchase order** with a link to each PO. **Create PO** pre-selects only lines not already on an open/closed PO; lines already on a PO appear in the modal with checkboxes disabled. **Cancelled** POs are omitted from `on_purchase_orders` and from the duplicate-line check when creating a PO, so those lines can be added to a new PO after **Cancel PO** on the purchase order detail page. **PDF and invoice output are unchanged** (pdf-service still loads raw order lines without this enrichment).

**Purchase orders:** Detail shows customer contact fields; lines support ordered-via (including Online and Other with notes), mark received, **Cancel PO** (open POs only; frees linked order lines for a new PO), and **Close PO** when all lines are received. Open PO lines that are not yet received are excluded from billable lines when creating invoices (invoice-service). PO detail includes **View PDF** and **Download PDF**.

**Tickets:** Attachments support images and other files; non-image types use file-type silhouettes. HEIC/HEIF is converted in the browser for preview (`heic2any`). Large uploads require the gateway JSON limit above.

**Billing:** Bill order flow (`/invoices/bill-order`) creates an invoice from an order; order billing page at `/orders/:id/billing`.

**UI:** Pill-shaped primary/secondary/icon and filter tab buttons; filter tabs (Open/Closed/All) and customer filter on list pages; plus button aligned with filters on Orders, Tickets, Invoices; shared ErrorBanner, BackArrow, TicketSelector; `formatDate` (mm/dd/yyyy in America/New_York) and `api/client`, `useListFetch`/`useDetailFetch` hooks.

**Styling:** Grid-based layout; compact table columns (e.g. col-id, col-date, col-status, col-amount) on list pages; short-field styling for IDs, dates, and amounts on detail views.

## Deployment

Production deploy uses Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, all backend services, frontend, Caddy for HTTPS). See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for quick start, migrations, and build notes. For Oracle Cloud and CI/CD setup, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT_ORACLE_CI_ACCESS.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_ORACLE_CI_ACCESS.md).
