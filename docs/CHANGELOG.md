# Changelog

Notable behavior and feature changes for A.N.D.Y. (Advanced Notation & Deployment Yard).

---

## Purchase order line visibility on orders & cancel PO

### Behavior

- **Order API:** `GET` and `PUT` order responses enrich each order line with **`on_purchase_orders`**: non-cancelled purchase orders that include that line (`purchase_order_id`, `po_number`, `purchase_order_status`). Cancelled POs are excluded.
- **Duplicate line on PO:** Creating a PO from an order still allows each order line on at most one *active* PO; lines tied only to **cancelled** POs can be selected again.
- **Cancel PO:** `PATCH /api/app/purchase-orders/:id/cancel` sets an **open** PO to `cancelled`. Purchase order detail includes a **Cancel PO** action (with confirmation).
- **Order detail UI:** Under each line’s description, a single-line **On purchase order** note (with links) uses `whitespace-nowrap` so table rows stay compact. **Create PO** only pre-checks eligible lines; lines already on a PO stay visible with disabled checkboxes.
- **PDFs / invoices:** No change. pdf-service continues to use plain line queries; PO notes do not appear on PDF output.

### Frontend typing

- **QuoteDetailPage** and **OrderDetailPage** annotate mapped line arrays as `LineRow[]` where a ternary previously widened types and broke strict `tsc`.

## Orders, Invoicing, Payment Reversal & Unit of Measure

### Order closing

- **Before:** An order could close as soon as all *billable* lines were fully invoiced. Lines still in `pending` were ignored, so the order sometimes closed while items remained to be billed.
- **After:** An order closes only when **every** line item is fully invoiced (`billing_status = 'invoiced'` and `quantity_billed >= quantity`). Users can keep adding lines to an order until all items are invoiced.
- **Implementation:** Invoice service uses `countOrderLinesNotFullyInvoiced` and calls `setOrderClosed` only when that count is 0.

### Payment reversal

- **Before:** Reversing a payment only deleted the payment and updated `amount_paid`. The order and its lines stayed closed/invoiced.
- **After:** Reversing a payment on an invoice:
  1. Deletes the payment and syncs `amount_paid`.
  2. For each line on that invoice, subtracts the invoiced quantity from the order line’s `quantity_billed` and sets `billing_status` back to `'billable'` when `quantity_billed` reaches 0.
  3. Sets the order status back to `'open'` if it was `'closed'`.
- **Implementation:** Invoice service adds `subtractOrderLineQuantityBilled`, `setOrderOpen`, and in `deletePayment` loads invoice lines, updates order lines, and reopens the order when appropriate.

### Payment history & negative balance

- **Totals:** Customer Payment History page has a totals section below the table: subtotals for invoice payments and deposits, and a grand total.
- **Negative balance:** Invoices can show a negative balance (credit) when payments plus applied deposits exceed the invoice total. `syncInvoiceAmountPaid` no longer caps `amount_paid` at `total`; it uses the raw sum of payments so overpayment remains as credit on the invoice.

### Unit of measure (LBR vs EA)

- **Before:** For items whose default U/M is LBR (e.g. weight), if the user selected EA (each) on an order line, the backend overwrote it with the item’s `unit_of_measure` (LBR).
- **After:** The client’s choice is respected. If the client sends a non-empty `unit_of_measure` (including `'EA'`), that value is used. The item’s U/M is used only when the client does not send a U/M (missing, null, or empty).
- **Implementation:** In order-service `quoteOrderController`, `createQuote`, `createOrder`, `updateQuote`, and `updateOrder` use “client sent explicit U/M → use it; else default from item or 'EA'” instead of “if EA then overwrite with item U/M”.

### Code / docs

- **README:** Project title and description use A.N.D.Y. and 19th Chamber Integrated.
- **package.json:** Root description updated to A.N.D.Y. (19th Chamber Integrated).
- **Global CSS:** `.btn-sidebar-chevron` is excluded from the common button border/outline rules so the sidebar expand/collapse arrows stay borderless and transparent.
